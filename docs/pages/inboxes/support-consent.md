## Support user consent preferences and spam-free inboxes

:::warning[ðŸš§ XMTP V3 Alpha]

The XMTP V3 SDKs are in **alpha**Â status and ready for you to start experimenting with.
However, we doÂ **not**Â recommend using alpha software in production apps. Software in this status will change as we add features and iterate based on feedback.


XMTP V3 includes breaking changes from V2, most of which will be mitigated by the SDKs. Guidance about the migration path from V2 to V3 will be delivered in forthcoming XMTP V3 release notes.

Join the [XMTP Devs ðŸ’ªÂ group chat](https://converse.xyz/group-invite/e-KZyw77m-7sjUmEk5lgu) in Converse to keep up with the latest updates.

In any open and permissionless messaging ecosystem, spam is an inevitable reality, and XMTP is no exception.

However, with XMTP, you can give your users inboxes that areÂ **spam-free spaces for chosen contacts only**Â by supporting user consent preferences.

To learn more, see [Understand how user consent preferences enable spam-free inboxes](/consent/user-consent).

Use the following methods to provide users with control over their messaging experience, ensuring their inboxes are tailored to their preferences and free from spam.

### Get new consent records from the network - coming soon
